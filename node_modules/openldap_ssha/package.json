  "readme": "# SSHA (salted SHA passwords)\n\nThis is a utility library to use with openldap.  I originally wanted\nto use bcrypt because I searched the internet too much, but on reading\nthe docs for openldap I discovered that the best available was \"SSHA\".\n\n> This is the salted version of the SHA scheme. It is believed to be\n> the most secure password storage scheme supported by\n> slapd. <http://www.openldap.org/doc/admin24/security.html>\n\nThe code is mostly just an adaptation of the Perl code found at\n<http://www.openldap.org/faq/data/cache/347.html>.  One of the tests\nin fact checks the expected output of 'secret' with password 'salt'\nagainst the output of the Perl program.\n\nMy application needs to use CAS  <http://www.jasig.org/cas> backed by\nldap, and so I cannot use anything other than the password schemes\nsupported out of the box by openldap.\n\n\n# Tests\n\nThree fairly simple tests have been added.  First whether 'secret' and\n'salt' make the expected hash, then whether a random password and salt\ncan be encoded and decoded, and finally whether a known hash\ngenerated by slappasswd for the password 'secret' can be properly\nverified.\n\nI use mocha for the tests; `npm install` followed by `make test`\nshould run them.\n\n",
